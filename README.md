# nibbelboard

A nibbelboard playing funny (and sometime political non correctly) sounds.

  


Major project goal is not generation of 100k+ downloads, it's much more about tying together several Android patterns in order to have these grouped in a more or less sensefull Android app. These patterns include:

  


  * Fragment Handling (layout and non layout based frags)
  * Tab Swipe
  * dynamic layout: calculation of widths@runtime
  * 9-Patch graphic works
  * Multi Language Handling
  * Array Handling via array.xml
  * Raw file handling (sound files)
  * Interaction with 3rd party apps (Whatsapp & Mail) using intents
  * Setting sytsem sounds (ringtones etc.)
  * HIGHLIGHT: hack to transfer XML fields in a fragment into the Fragment Java Code

Basically that's all the application contains/chalks out, the application has been created based on **Android Studio version 0.3.2**, the whole project has been checked in to github so you should easily be able to checkout the project and import locally....

  
Have fun, Flo!
